# Lectures on Algebraic and Semi-Algebraic Reasoning

These materials are collected from a mini course for PhD students and
faculty at IMDEA Madrid on the topic of algebraic and semi-algebraic
geometry for formal methods.

Topics include:

  - __Algebraic reasoning:__  Hilbert's nullstellensatz, Grobner bases and Application.
  - __Semi-algebraic reasoning:__ Positive polynomials, Sum of Squares programming and alternatives.
  - __Applications:__ Proving properties of programs and cyber-physical systems, control systems and robotics.
