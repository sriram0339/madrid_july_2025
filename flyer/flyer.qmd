Proving properties of programs and cyber-physical systems requires us
to reason about nonlinear arithmetic. In the 1920s Tarski developed an
automated decision procedure that demonstrated decidability of the
nonlinear arithmetic over reals and developed a quantifier elimination
procedure. Later work by Collins made numerous algorithmic
improvements. More recently, deeper connections have been discovered
between the problem of proving algebraic and semi-algebraic properties
of systems and areas such as convex optimization and measure
theory.

We will present some of these approaches and discuss their
power when it comes to proving properties of programs and differential
equations. Topics include:

  * __Algebraic reasoning:__  Hilbert's nullstellensatz, Grobner bases and Application.
  * __Semi-algebraic reasoning:__ Positive polynomials, Sum of Squares programming and alternatives.
  * __Applications:__ Proving properties of programs and cyber-physical systems, control systems and robotics.
